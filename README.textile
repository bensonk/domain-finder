h2. Domain Finder

This is a tool I hacked together in a few minutes to help find catchy domains
for new projects.  It takes one or more TLDs on the command line, and looks for
words that end with that string.  Then, it filters that list based on whether
the domains are currently registered (by doing a simple dns lookup on the
domain).  It's a bit hacky, but it does work.
